            <h1><span>Our firm</span> Here to get you there</h1>
            <p>Dear visitor,</p>
            <p>I am very proud to present <strong>Cain Lamarre</strong>.

We take pride in the close relationships we build with our clients and the role we play as advisors in helping them achieve and even exceed their most ambitious goals.</p>

            <p>Gina Doucet <br> Managing partner of <strong>Cain Lamarre</strong></p>

            <div class="collapsedContent">
              <h3>They know how you need, right where you <br> need it</h3>
              <p>Our unique structure enables us to provide the kind of approachable, community-based services no other firm can provide. Grouped together in hard-working teams in large and small centers throughout the province, our legal professionals work in synergy to provide the full range of services and expertise you expect from a leading law firm.</p>
              <p>With more than 200 legal professionals, lawyers, and notaries on staff, <strong>Cain Lamarre</strong> is the firm best equipped to serve clients in all regions of the province. </p>
              <p>Our Québec-wide presence allows us to keep a finger on the pulse in every region and maintain in-depth knowledge of the people, business partners, companies, and distinguishing features that make each region so unique. Which means we’re better able to take into account each client’s environment and realities to provide the services they need.</p>
              <p>Having offices throughout Québec also means that our lawyers and notaries are exactly where our clients need them to be, and can act in a timely, appropriate, and more cost-effective fashion. Whichever office you deal with, you’ll find the same values: approachability, simplicity, and authenticity in all our relationships, a commitment to the communities we serve, and a desire to maintain our reputation for excellence.</p>
              <h3>Expertise</h3>
              <p><strong>Cain Lamarre</strong> has more than 200 professionals on staff specializing in all areas of law and all sectors of the economy. Across Québec, our experts pool their skills and know-how to provide innovative and effective legal solutions to address the needs of our clients—institutions, businesses, and individuals alike.</p>
              <p>Our legal experts enjoy strong credibility and an enviable reputation, both among clients and within the legal community. Their ranks include eminent lawyers respected by the highest courts, influential legal advisors, bar presidents, Advocatus Emeritus, Queen’s Counsel, and recipients of the prestigious Médaille du Barreau. Such is the distinguished makeup of our firm, some of whose members have been named to the bench.</p>
              <h3>Clientele</h3>
              <p>In addition to our roster of institutional and corporate clients, we have extensive experience serving small and mid-sized businesses—including those active in the new economy—Aboriginal communities and populations, and a wide array of individual clients in need of legal services. No matter who they are or what their needs, our clients can count on effective, custom-tailored legal solutions at competitive rates.</p>
              <h3>Values</h3>
              <p>A few years ago, we adopted a Charter of Values setting forth the principles our firm is built on: respect and fairness, professional and economic efficiency, generosity, trust and friendship, honesty and integrity, engagement, team spirit, and a sense of belonging. These values are those of our founders, and they remain very much a part of us, still guiding our actions and decisions today.</p>
              <h3>History</h3>
              <p><strong>Cain Lamarre</strong> is the result of the merger in 1999 of three well-established firms. Cain Lamarre Wells, founded in 1928 in Chicoutimi, was the oldest law firm in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Gauthier Nepveu Leblanc, which opened its doors in Sept-Îles in 1951, was one of the most important players in the development of the North Shore, Casgrain Desrosiers Lévesque Bujold Villeneuve, a trusted name in Rimouski since 1877, was one of Canada’s oldest law firms. Later, the firm, which was already present in Montréal, set up shop in Québec City, then opened offices across the province.</p>
              <h3>Case management</h3>
              <p>We believe that effective case management depends on the assignment of appropriate case resources, budgetary oversight, respect for deadlines, and quality control.</p>
              <p>Offering you cost-effective solutions is one of our primary concerns. We understand that economic reality demands that businesses and individuals seek out the best possible legal services at the lowest possible price, which is why we have developed decentralized work procedures and a flexible and competitive fee structure. Our clients enjoy all the benefits of a network of over 200 legal professionals without paying the kind of hourly rates charged by most big city firms.</p>
              <p>We have also remained faithful to the principles of integrity that drive us to always seek the most effective solution for our clients without compromising on the quality of our services. </p>
              <p><strong>Cain Lamarre</strong> also has a global presence through an alliance with TAGLaw, an international network of over 150 legal firms present on all continents, allowing us to serve you better in the United States, Europe, Asia, and around the world.</p>
              <p>Over the years, we have forged an impressive network of contacts we can tap into to serve our clientele. Our legal professionals cultivate and maintain strategic relationships with municipal, provincial, and federal politicians and elected officials, lawyers from other national and international firms, members of the media across Québec and around the world, and leading economic stakeholders. Used wisely, this web of contacts can be helpful in finding legal solutions. It also enhances efficiency and serves as a powerful economic lever for many of our clients.</p>
              <p>The network is further strengthened by the active role our lawyers play in the social and economic life of the communities where the firm has roots and continues to develop today.</p>
